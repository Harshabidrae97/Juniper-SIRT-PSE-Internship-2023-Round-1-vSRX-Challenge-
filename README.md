# Juniper-SIRT-PSE-Internship-2023-Round-1-vSRX-Challenge-
The challenge has two parts.


The challenge has two parts. Part 1 requires you to setup a virtual network using VMware Workstation Pro or VMware fusion Pro (Free trials are available for both platforms). The virtual network consists of one Ubuntu server and a Juniper vSRX Evaluation version. Only once the network is setup, and traffic between the hosts is up, you will be able to move to part 2. Part two of the challenge requires you to configure a filter on the vSRX to block specific kind of traffic.
To complete the challenge, you will need to leverage a variety of skills like Junos configuration, Linux routing, VMware virtualization, even Goggle-ing.
